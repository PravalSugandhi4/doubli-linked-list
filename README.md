# 🔁 Doubly Linked List in C++

This project is a simple and efficient implementation of a **Doubly Linked List** in the C programming language. A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains a reference to both the next and previous node in the sequence, allowing traversal in both directions.

## 📌 Features

- 🔧 Create a new doubly linked list
- ➕ Insert nodes at:
  - Beginning
  - End
  - Specific position
- ❌ Delete nodes from:
  - Beginning
  - End
  - Specific position
- 🔍 Traverse forward and backward
- 📃 Display the list contents
- 🔄 Reverse the list
